# Hello there!

- My name is Simon Pivoda and I'm big IT enthusiast. 
- I'm from Czech Republic, currently living in Prague.
- My interest include both programming and learning new things.
- Also I'm a big fan of Star Wars.

## In this repository I want to little by little add the codes I wrote along my learning journey. :)
